Fullstack Web Developer @ BRDigitech | Blockchain Technology | AWS | MERN Stack | C#.Net | TypeScript | JavaScript

I specialize in creating decentralized applications (dApps) that interact with blockchains, including both EVM-compatible chains and Solana. With experience connecting wallets ad integrating smart contracts to dApps for these platforms, I deliver secure and seamless blockchain integrations. At BRDigitech, I work on full-stack development with a back-end focus, using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and leveraging AWS services like Cognito, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

I also contribute to blockchain-based projects such as tokenized real estate and cryptocurrency staking, utilizing Solidity and other blockchain technologies.
